A powerful scripting language for creating Minecraft servers, built on the Minestom library. SwoftLang combines the flexibility of a scripting language with the performance benefits of C++ and Java interoperability, making it ideal for developing custom Minecraft server experiences.

## Overview

SwoftLang is a dedicated scripting language designed specifically for Minecraft server development. It leverages both Java and C++ through JNI, allowing server developers to write efficient code that interacts seamlessly with the Minestom ecosystem. This approach provides the ease of use of a scripting language while maintaining high performance for server operations.
